Pangeo Roadmap
==============================

This document outlines the Pangeo roadmap for the next 2 years.

The Pangeo project is a community effort. We intend to adapt as the community evolves and new opportunities arise. However we believe this roadmap would still apply to changes in the geoscience ecosystem.

The Pangeo roadmap is organized into 2 sections:

1. **Supporting the Pangeo Community**: Ongoing activities to support the Pangeo community in adopting best practices and open source software.
2. **Supporting the Evoloution of the Geoscience Software Stack**: Ongoing and dedicated activitites to deliver software for large-scale geoscience.

Supporting the Pangeo Community
--------------------------------

The Pangeo Steering Committee is committed to maintaining the following community forums:

1. `Pangeo Discourse <https://discourse.pangeo.io>`_
2. `Pangeo Showcase <https://pangeo.io/pangeo-showcase.html>`_
3. `Pangeo Twitter <https://twitter.com/pangeo_data>`_
4. Community events at conferences

Pangeo is looking to hire a part- or full-time communications manager who help with those forums as well as **creating a monthly newsletter**.

This communications manager will also help define a strategy for attending and presenting at conferences attendance and organizing Pangeo-dedicated events. This communications manager will help define what, where and how we communicate about Pangeo. This communications manager will also help revamp the website.

Supporting the Evoloution of the Geoscience Software Stack
----------------------------------------------------------

The Pangeo Steering Committee will drive the evolution of the Geoscience Software Stack. This will include:

1. Setting higher level goals to guide the community in development and in writing proposals. For example, Pangeo advocates for the use of STAC to facilitate access to data. We believe setting higher level goals is a core function as a network of resources continues to evolve and sharing conventions is key to cross-platform collaboration.
2. Developing geoscience software and platforms. For example, the Pangeo community is actively engaged in the evolution of the Zarr specification. 
3. Identify new and exciting developments in OSS community and encourage them, via github, Twitter and tutorials.
